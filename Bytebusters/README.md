# A brief of the prototype
### Geopedia
A one stop platform for all your Geological needs.<br>
#### What's the issue ?
Data available to Geologists from NASA satellites are unarranged, unlabeled and hard to understand.
Satellites scan the earth in form of blocks and it becomes hard to differentiate data like RADAR scans, EMIT(Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation) data, SAR(Synthetic aperture radar) data, etc,. on the basis of location's conventional name. 
#### How do we solve the issue !?
We collect and catalogue goelogical data from satellite and present it to the user using Google maps API. This makes it easier for the user to locate the particular land that he/she needs to access the dataset of.

#### Additional feature !
> A home tab where we share globally generic geological data/info from NASA webpages.<br>
> A bookmark section where users can save frequently visited sections for quick and easy access
# Steps for code execution
> Clone the repository<br>
> Open the folder with Android Studio<br>
> Obtain google maps api key from official site.(starts with "AIza..")<br>
> Create MAPS_API_KEY = "your_api_key" in local.properties<br>
> Run the Project after Gradle Build finishes inside AVD or Any other android device connected using debugging
# Future Scope
> Using API parsing to automate data feed into the application to make the process more streamlined<br>
> Introducing membership subscriptions for regular users to enhance and upgrade their experience by offering exclusive perks and services
