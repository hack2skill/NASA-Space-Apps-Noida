    <p>Greetings {{name}},</p>
    
    </div>
    
    <p>We are thrilled for you to embark on this incredible space adventure from {{source}} to {{destination}}. The journey from {{source}} to {{destination}} is {{srcdistance}} million miles away, will be a unique experience. <b>The weather at {{source}} is {{srcatmosphere}}, while the weather at {{destination}} is {{dstatmosphere}}.</b> This journey will give you a firsthand experience of the stark contrast between the two planets. Let's dive into your exciting one-week itinerary:</p>    
    <p><strong>Day 1:</strong> Your journey begins with a momentous launch from {{source}}. Feel the rumble of the rockets as you accelerate out of the atmosphere and into the vastness of space. Watch our planet get smaller and smaller as you head towards your destination.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Day 2-3:</strong> Cruise through the solar system towards Mars. Gaze out the window at passing planets, asteroids, and other celestial wonders. The endless blackness dotted with stars will make you feel so small yet filled with wonder. Enjoy zero gravity as you float around the cabin.</p>  
    
    <p><strong>Day 4:</strong> Strap on your spacesuit and oxygen tank to summit Mount Olympus. At an elevation of over 21,000 feet, it will be a challenging hike. But once at the peak, you'll be rewarded with a breathtaking 360 degree panorama of the rusty Martian landscape. See if you can spot the polar ice caps!</p>
    
    <p><strong>Day 5:</strong> Venture to Phobos, one of Mars' mysterious moons. Walk along the surface and explore its massive crater Stickney, caused by a major impact. Phobos offers unique perspectives on Mars against the backdrop of space. Spend a quiet moment contemplating our place in the universe.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Day 6:</strong> Meet up with Curiosity, NASA's intrepid Mars rover. Chat "face-to-face" with engineers on Earth as Curiosity shows you around its exciting discoveries. See the rover's laser zap rocks, dig trenches, and analyze soil samples up close.</p> 
    
    <p><strong>Day 7:</strong> Begin the three month long return voyage to Earth. Reminisce on your amazing Martian experiences. Journal, watch movies, play games, and chat with friends back home through video messages. One day, share your once-in-a-lifetime journey with others to inspire the next generation of space explorers.</p>
    
    <p>Please take note of these precautions for your journey:</p>
    
  <ul> <li>Pack plenty of freeze-dried astronaut food and water</li> <li>Bring motion sickness medication for the long space travel</li> <li>Make sure your spacesuit and equipment are in top condition</li></ul>
    
    <p>We wish you an incredible adventure! Reach out with any other questions. </p>
